#pragma mark ABSTRACT

// This singleton class loads all registered parsers and keeps instances around for the duration of the app lifetime.
// A parser is thus an extremely long-lived object, which can store state and talk to asynchronous APIs. This gives
// developers the chance to implemenent parsers for web based services, Spotlight, Image Capture etc. Just before the
// app quits the parsers are unloaded, at which time they can clean up...
