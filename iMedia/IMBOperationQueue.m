// This constant controls how wide the queue will be, i.e. how many threads are running concurrently. More threads 
// will lead to better load balancing, but it also increases the risk of resource contention. For example, if lot's  
// of threads are doing file I/O, then the disk is seeking around like crazy, and alle threads are being slowed down. 
// In this case a narrow serial queue would achieve better file I/O throughput. Change this constant to find the  
// optimum middle ground for a wide variety of different machines...
